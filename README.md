# CalorieTracker
This is a simple JavaScript Calorie Tracker built using the module pattern. The user can enter a meal/food item and its number of calories and then add the meal/item to the list. The app displays the list and the total calories of all items in the list. The app uses the browser's local storage to persist data.
